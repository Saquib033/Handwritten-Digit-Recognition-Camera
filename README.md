# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Camera
Real-time digit classification using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and uses convolutional neural network layers for feature extraction and classification. The system captures input from a webcam, preprocesses the region of interest, and displays the predicted digit and model performance metrics.
